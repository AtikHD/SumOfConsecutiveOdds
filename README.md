# SumOfConsecutiveOdds

This Java console application calculates the sum of the first Y consecutive odd numbers starting from X for multiple test cases.

## 📋 Features

- Reads the number of test cases (N)
- For each test case:
  - Inputs integers X and Y
  - Calculates the sum of the first Y odd numbers starting at X if X is odd, or starting at X+1 if X is even
- Outputs the sum for each test case

## 🧮 Example


## 💻 Technologies Used

- Java
- Scanner for console input
- Loops and conditional statements

## 📁 File

- `SumOfConsecutiveOdds.java` – Main Java source file

## 🏁 How to Run

1. Clone the repo or copy the `.java` file
2. Compile using:
   ```bash
   javac SumOfConsecutiveOdds.java

### Extended Description (for adding more context)

This program serves as a practice exercise for fundamental programming concepts such as input handling, loops, and conditional logic in Java. It accepts multiple test cases and, for each, calculates the sum of a specified number of consecutive odd integers starting from a given number.

The solution demonstrates how to:

- Use nested loops and counters effectively
- Implement conditional logic to adjust starting points based on parity (odd/even)
- Perform iterative arithmetic computations
- Read and process multiple inputs dynamically

This foundational program can be further improved with mathematical formula optimizations and more robust input validation, forming a good base for learning Java programming.
